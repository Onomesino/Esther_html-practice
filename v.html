	<h1>RIVERS OF LIVING OF LIVING WATER.</h1>
	<p>He that beliveth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (john 7:38).</p>

	<h2>POUR FORTH RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
	<p>Drip down, heavens, from above, And let the clouds pour down righteousness; let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit, And righteousness sprout with it I, the LORD, have created it</p>
